# About
This project was written for fun to explore low level programming. The 6502 processor was chosen for its simplicity.

The project includes an emulator and a custom hand written compiler.

## Emulator
Again, this emulator was written for fun; therefore, it was not ment to run any existing programs. For example, the emulator does not take account cpu cycles and ignores interupts.

## Crust
Crust is a custom language written to be used with the emulator. The syntax resembles of Rust but has the simplicity of C.

Crust is still work in progress and is not ready to be used.
